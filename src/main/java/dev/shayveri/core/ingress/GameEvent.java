/**
 * A4 - GameEvent (A4) is GameEventRequest (A2)'s data plus the server-added
 * fields, same relationship A3 has with A1
 *
 * The telemetry pattern:
 * Telemetry flows through three shapes, each with one job:
 *
 * Roblox JSON  →  Request (record)  →  Document (class)  →  stored / iterable
 *                 validate at door      + server fields
 *
 * Request (TelemetrySnapshotRequest, GameEventRequest) - the doorway.
 * An immutable record that mirrors the incoming JSON. Its only job is to
 * be validated, then converted and discarded.
 *
 * Document (TelemetrySnapshot, GameEvent) - the resident. A mutable class
 * that copies the validated request data and adds CORE's own trusted fields
 * (receivedAt, the Mongo id). This is what gets stored and worked with.
 *
 * The client shapes the request; CORE alone shapes the document. The
 * client never gets to set server-authoritative fields.
 *
 * Why an event is different telemetry:
 * Both are "telemetry in," but they answer different questions:
 *
 *   Snapshot: "how is the server right now" (periodic, ~10s); one clock
 *             (receivedAt, server); one object in; disposable, 7-day TTL.
 *   Event:    "this specific thing just happened" (a death, a round change);
 *             two clocks (occurredAt client + receivedAt server), the gap is
 *             diagnostic; a JSON array in (batched); permanent, no TTL - it
 *             is the research dataset.
 *
 * A snapshot is a state reading; an event is a logged fact. That is why they
 * get separate endpoints, separate documents, and opposite retention.
 *
 * How we validate the bare shape, then make it reliably iterable:
 * Validate at the boundary. The request record carries validation
 * annotations (@NotBlank, @NotNull) directly on its fields. The controller
 * marks the parameter @Valid, so Spring checks the raw shape before any
 * logic runs. Anything malformed becomes a 400 with field errors; it never
 * reaches the service.
 *
 * Normalize away nulls. The record's compact constructor swaps missing
 * collections for empty ones (data = data == null ? Map.of() : data;). After
 * this, optional maps are never null - always at least an empty map.
 *
 * Convert to a guaranteed-complete object. A from(request, receivedAt)
 * factory copies the validated fields and stamps the server fields into the
 * document. Because every field is either validated-present or defaulted-
 * non-null, downstream code can iterate or call .size() with zero null checks.
 *
 * Consumes: @Document("game_events") and @Id, exactly as in A3. No
 * @Indexed(expireAfter) - the absence IS the design decision (events are
 * permanent). A plain @Indexed on placeId: heatmap queries will filter by it.
 *
 * Done when: D3 shows a batch of 3 posted events -> 3 documents here, and
 * the collection has no TTL index.
