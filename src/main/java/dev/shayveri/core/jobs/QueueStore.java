 * J6 - the rule-5 seam for the hot queue path. The contract is shaped around ONE guarantee it must

 * keep that guarantee - claimOne is a single conceptual operation, never a findable-then-takeable
 * pair, because splitting it is exactly the race the acceptance test hunts.

 * Consumes: nothing - ours.
