/**
 * N3 - the durable node registry document. Deliberately holds NO liveness - liveness is Redis's job
 * (N6/N7), because it is hot, expiring state and this collection is the permanent record. Keeping
 * the two apart is a design decision: the durable truth survives restarts, the liveness truth
 * self-expires.
 *
 * THE IDEMPOTENCY KEY: @Id is nodeId, the agent's OWN id, NOT a generated one. That single choice
 * is what makes re-registration idempotent - a second register with the same nodeId is a Mongo
 * upsert (overwrite), never a duplicate row. The acceptance criterion "re-registration is
 * idempotent" is satisfied by the id choice, not by logic.
 *
 * Consumes: @Document("nodes"), @Id. No TTL anywhere here.
 *
 * TODO(averi): fields @Id String nodeId; String hostname; Map<String,Object> capabilities;
 * int maxConcurrentJobs; Instant registeredAt; Instant lastRegisteredAt. Constructor + getters;
 * a static from(NodeRegisterRequest, Instant) factory.
